# Java
1. The underlying data structure is Hashtable. 
2. Insertion order is not preserved and it is based on hash code of the keys. 
3. Heterogeneous objects are allowed for both keys and values. 
4. Null key (or) null value is not allowed otherwise we will get NullPointerException. 
5. Duplicate keys are allowed but values can be duplicated. 
6. Every method present inside Hashtable is syncronized and hence Hashtable objet is 
Thread-safe.
